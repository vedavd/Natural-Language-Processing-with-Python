And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ”appropriate” but also ”overdue” and ”a prime example of this administration’s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ”[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia’s worldwide aggression, including its   operations,” wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ”Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.” Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ”much tougher” actions and said three times that Obama had ”finally found his tongue.” Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama’s real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ”tie Trump’s hands” or ”box him in,” meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country’s embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad’s forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ”find” missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  —   Putin’s longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump’s extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  —   the idea that they helped Trump win  —   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump’s legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies’ concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ”no one really knows what happened.” He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ”get on with our lives and do more important things.” However, at week’s end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  —   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia’s hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister’s recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ”the bigger man,” even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ”Great move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!” At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iXoMCc19dk51","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"cc0f87b3-1f39-462a-b7a3-6af4184a8a34","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1583677284471,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1246,"user":{"displayName":"Veda Vamsidhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmAE70W14P9PKzBdDef6S2EV-kwPo4w8tV2MCr=s64","userId":"08603471575352189252"}}},"source":["#Check the lenght of dataset\n","#This is nothing but length of the dataframe\n","len(npr)\n","#So, there are 11992 Articles present in this dataset"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["11992"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DBI8DjXwhZrl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"outputId":"7c8c84da-b3f3-4a4b-de6f-394a7a25b886","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1583677356361,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":996,"user":{"displayName":"Veda Vamsidhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmAE70W14P9PKzBdDef6S2EV-kwPo4w8tV2MCr=s64","userId":"08603471575352189252"}}},"source":["#Lets take alook at Article 4000\n","npr['Article'][4000]"],"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'The headline shocked the   world of the surface Navy: Seven sailors aboard the destroyer USS Fitzgerald were killed, and other crew members injured, when the warship collided with a cargo vessel off Japan. As the Navy family grieves, both it and the wider world are asking the same question: How did this happen? The short answer is that no one knows  —   yet. Official inquiries into what led up to the encounter could take months or more. The Navy and the U. S. Coast Guard both likely will eventually issue reports that describe what happened and could make recommendations for preventing another such accident. ”I will not speculate on how long these investigations will last,” said Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy’s 7th Fleet. The Fitzgerald and the other ships of Destroyer Squadron 15, based outside Tokyo, fall under his authority. There are clues, however, that explain how something like the Fitzgerald’s collision could happen, including photographs of the ships involved, navigation data about the container ship ACX Crystal and the experience the Navy has had with past mishaps. The $1. 8 billion Fitzgerald is one of the most modern and technologically advanced warships afloat, capable of using its powerful sensors to look up into space, if necessary, and reach up to hit targets there with its battery of missiles. The destroyer still has a human crew, however, most of which was likely asleep around 2:30 a. m. local time when it collided with the Crystal. There was no moon over the waters south of Tokyo Bay, according to local accounts, and the channel there is frequently crowded with ships on their way into and out of the Japanese capital. Vessels of all sizes sail to other ports in Asia or head east into the vast Pacific. Sailors in the Fitzgerald’s combat information center and on its bridge are responsible for using the ship’s sensors to plot the location of each one, as well as the directions they’re headed and the speed at which they’re sailing. Officers and sailors must at all times keep what the Navy calls good ”situational awareness” about not only what their own ship is doing, but about what might be ahead in the next patch of ocean where the Fitzgerald wants to sail. In 2012 a sibling of the Fitzgerald, the destroyer USS Porter, was in a congested,   seaway called the Strait of Hormuz  —   the ribbon of water that connects the Persian Gulf with the Arabian Sea  —   when it collided with an oil tanker. The Navy’s investigation later found that as sailors tried to keep track of the traffic all around them, including those ships headed the other direction, they lost focus on their own immediate course ahead. When the tanker Otowasan suddenly loomed ahead, Cmdr. Martin Arriola ordered the Porter to turn left to cross ahead of the huge other ship to avoid a   crash. But he hadn’t done so with enough time, and not even ordering full speed at the last minute could get the destroyer safely clear. The Otowasan hit the Porter along its right  —   or starboard  —   side, in a location on the ship very near where the ACX Crystal hit the Fitzgerald early Saturday. But when the sun came up and photos appeared of both ships, they revealed the Crystal had damage on the left or port side of its bow  —   suggesting it might have been traveling in the same direction as the Fitzgerald. It may have been trailing the smaller destroyer at a perpendicular angle that stayed relatively the same even as the distance between the ships closed: ”constant bearing, decreasing range.” If the crew of the Fitzgerald was watching what was ahead of them and got used to the presence of the container ship on their starboard quarter because it didn’t appear to be moving in either direction relative to the destroyer  —   even though it was getting closer all the while  —   the sailors might not have realized what was happening until they were in extremis. Another similar possibility: the Fitzgerald wanted to sail east, say, and its course crossed over that of the Crystal, heading north. The destroyer might have been like someone trying to get across a busy street, thinking it could get out of the way of the oncoming cars in time  —   in this case, a miscalculation. Investigators will focus closely on what the crews on both ships were doing. When the fast attack submarine USS Hartford collided with the amphibious transport USS New Orleans in 2009, discipline on the sub was lax, the Navy later found. The Hartford’s captain never came into the control room during the transit through the crowded Strait of Hormuz. The navigator was in the wardroom listening to his iPod. It’s possible that no one was on the bridge of the Crystal  —   even huge container ships are comparatively lightly crewed, compared with Navy ships, and unlike warships, often use an autopilot. In the wide open Pacific, mariners sometimes let ”Iron Mike” take the helm. After a series of accidents, the U. S. Coast Guard warned mariners last year about the dangers involved with relying too heavily on autopilot. The Fitzgerald’s bridge almost certainly was crewed, by sailors and officers on the overnight ”midwatch” and those are the watchstanders who may have made the critical decisions about what to do or not do before the collision. Were they managing a whole screen full of contacts and too distracted to notice the one bearing down on them? Or was it a quiet night with so little to do that the crew became bored and complacent? Investigators will conduct interviews, review navigational data and could even listen to recordings of what happened on the bridge, like the one eventually released from the Porter. One detail already is known: The Fitzgerald’s commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was in his cabin at the time of the accident, 7th Fleet’s Aucoin said. The captain’s compartment is located on the starboard side of the ship that was crushed by the Crystal, and Benson was hurt  —   the Japanese Coast Guard took him to shore by helicopter. Other sailors were berthed in compartments farther below decks, which were flooded by the Crystal’s bulbous bow. In all, two berthing compartments and one machinery space, which houses one of the gas turbines for making the ship’s electrical power, quickly filled with seawater. ”Heroic efforts prevented the flooding from catastrophically spreading, which could have caused the ship to founder or sink,” Aucoin said. ”It could have been much worse.” The Fitzgerald limped into Tokyo under its own power the crew of the   Aegis combatant used a magnetic compass and their backup instruments to get home with only one of the ship’s two propellers. The destroyer now needs millions of dollars’ worth of repairs, including a visit to a dry dock, before it could be ready to take another mission. The Navy identified the seven sailors who died in the accident on Sunday evening. Acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley vowed that service officials would answer the question everyone is now asking: how it could have happened. ”In due time, the United States Navy will fully investigate the cause of this tragedy,” he said, ”and I ask all of you to keep the Fitzgerald families in your thoughts and prayers as we begin the task of answering the many questions before us.”'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"r215fsA5hrSq","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#We do not know what topic these articles belong to\n","#We try to figure the topic for each of these Articles\n","#Before running LDA, we perform a little bit of preprocessing\n","#We perform Count Vectorization\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ezg0nPPJiQdg","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#Create an instance of Count Vectorizer\n","#We ignore certain terms for example common words.\n","#So, we specify maximum and minimum frequency for a term to be included in the document term matrix\n","#max_df gets rid of terms that are really common across the documents\n","#Value of max_df is between 0 and 1.\n","#PARAMETER 1:         max_df=0.9 is going to discard words that show up in 90 percent of documents\n","#PARAMETER 2:         min_df=  is the wrds that show up minimum amount of times\n","#You can actually pass the values to max_df and min_df as a ratio between 0 and 1\n","#You can also pass an integer,it will actually take into account as a raw number of documents\n","#If I pass min_df=2: this says that the minimum frequency for a word to be counted into the Count Vectorizer\n","#has to show up in atleast two documents\n","#Benefits achieved due to specifying max_df and min_df\n","#######This helps in throwing out some common words\n","#######This helps in throwing out some random words maybe typos and misspelling\n","#PARAMETER 3:         stop_words:    Specifies the language of stopwords\n","cv=CountVectorizer(max_df=0.9,min_df=2,stop_words='english')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"oIirPrZ3iREv","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#Other methods of performing above\n","#Tokenize the words\n","#Remove stopwords using Spacy"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"I6QSFgxHmbT5","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#There is no train test split involved as this is unseupervised\n","#We are fit transforming to the entire dataset: Creating the Document Term Matrix of the Article Column\n","dtm=cv.fit_transform(npr['Article'])\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"P0EBdf0SqALW","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52},"outputId":"54cb8591-496f-4ccf-b8c8-a303bea78955","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1583679550687,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":945,"user":{"displayName":"Veda Vamsidhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmAE70W14P9PKzBdDef6S2EV-kwPo4w8tV2MCr=s64","userId":"08603471575352189252"}}},"source":["#Check the Document Term Matrix\n","dtm"],"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<11992x54777 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'\n","\twith 3033388 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ijBNICoOqC4S","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#We have 54777 terms in the document term matrix\n","#Now perform LDA\n","from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iDnxRQ06r4HG","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#There is no specific number for n_components\n","#It purely depends on domain experience and familiraty with the domain from where the dataset is from\n","#If we put n_components=7, taht means we want 7 topics to be returned\n","#If we want more details like...

politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ”appropriate” but also ”overdue” and ”a prime example of this administration’s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ”[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia’s worldwide aggression, including its   operations,” wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ”Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.” Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ”much tougher” actions and said three times that Obama had ”finally found his tongue.” Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama’s real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ”tie Trump’s hands” or ”box him in,” meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country’s embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad’s forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ”find” missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  —   Putin’s longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump’s extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  —   the idea that they helped Trump win  —   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump’s legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies’ concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ”no one really knows what happened.” He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ”get on with our lives and do more important things.” However, at week’s end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  —   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia’s hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister’s recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ”the bigger man,” even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ”Great move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!” At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":62}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"75402iHRHrRu","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"a7a6d230-f6d5-4b9f-8eff-dcbe3a2b8b0a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1583687748686,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1134,"user":{"displayName":"Veda Vamsidhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmAE70W14P9PKzBdDef6S2EV-kwPo4w8tV2MCr=s64","userId":"08603471575352189252"}}},"source":["#We are not interested in the probabilities\n","#we are interested in the index position of the highest probability\n","topic_results[0].argmax()"],"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":63}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lCR5ljkiHrUg","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["npr['Topic']=topic_results.argmax(axis=1)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-NFcLmeJJh4H","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":406},"outputId":"2db0f6b5-c5f0-4965-b3aa-ad49c4827264","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1583687807616,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":945,"user":{"displayName":"Veda Vamsidhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmAE70W14P9PKzBdDef6S2EV-kwPo4w8tV2MCr=s64","userId":"08603471575352189252"}}},"source":["npr"],"execution_count":65,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Article</th>\n","      <th>Topic</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>In the Washington of 2016, even when the polic...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Donald Trump has used Twitter  —   his prefe...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Updated at 2:50 p. m.
